# Chrome-extension-experiment
First attempt at creating a custom chrome extension
Goal:
This is going to be my first attempt (in life) to create a Chrome extension, thought the process would be cool to learn (and it should be).

Description:
You ever feel tired from applying to all these companies and the job postings all turn out to be unreliable or straight up misleading?  I want to create one that allows user to mouse hover company title and a Glassdoor review site of the company shows, and auto filters out companies that are known to sell their "training courses".
